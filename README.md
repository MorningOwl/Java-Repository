# Java-Repository
This repository contains Java projects, classworks, and exercises I have done in the past.
[Classwork] Works that contains code related to assignments given in class. 
[Exercise] Random coding to brush up on Java.
[Project] Personal projects I have created for the Java language.
All of my code are open and free but I do ask for credit on any borrowed code.
Thank you!
