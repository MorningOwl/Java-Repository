 * This is the enumeration class of Rank. Rank is the "value" of a Suit. Ranks are represented as a String and does not have any true value.
 * For example, TWO does not equal the number 2, but is equal to the String Two or "2". The true value of the rank can be set in the Card class.  
 * This allows more flexibility in defining the value of a Rank for games.
